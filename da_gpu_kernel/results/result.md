Parameter settings:

1. penalty = 100
2. Monte Carlo steps = 100,000

When tested individually, only constraint 2 and constraint 6 passed their test.

When combine these two constraints and test together, both of them passed the test.

However, all other constraints and combination of constraints failed their constraints test
